# assembly
Up to now, this repository stores my own 8086/8088 CPU assembly codes.

Note: The codes here need to be run in DOS mode. On my PC I have installed dosbox (A virtual machine which can provide dos environment), and I assemble and link the programs in that specific environment.

I am a new learner of assembly language, so there can be mistakes or bad instructions. However, I am willing to proceed.

Thanks for your visit and advice. :D
